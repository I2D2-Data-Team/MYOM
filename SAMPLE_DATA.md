# Sample Data

An <a href="https://github.com/I2D2-Data-Team/MYOM/blob/main/data/sample_data.csv" target="_blank">example input file</a> with dummy data is available for download as a CSV file on our <a href="https://github.com/I2D2-Data-Team/MYOM" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. The file is comprised of 10 columns including county name (`county`) and country FIPS code (`fips`) together with variables of different data types (string, integer, double, dichotomous character/numeric).
